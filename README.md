# Budget Application
This app was created to help people manage their finances. This is done by giving users the ability to track how much money they have left to spend before they are completely out of funds.
This is a solution that will give you up to date information about your remaining funds as long as you continue to manage it properly.

<strong>To start:</strong> add your funds/savings that you have left to spend by clicking the "ADD MONEY" button. Next enter in the name of your source (ie. Savings, Payday, etc.) and then amount of money you would like to add.
You can also add a description, however this is optional. After all information entered click the "ADD FUNDS" button.

<strong>Adding Reoccurring Bills:</strong> Start by clicking the "NEW BILL" button. Enter the name of your bill, the amount that's due (the more accurate the informtion the better) and lastly enter the day of the month the bill is due.
Once information is completed click the "ADD BILL" button and repeat this process as many times as needed. Once all bills have been entered you are now ready to enjoy the benefits of this app.

<strong>Paying Bills:</strong> Once you are ready to pay one of your bills, simply click the "PAY" button next to the desired bill to be paid. Once bill has been paid, the pay button will be temporarily disabled.
At the end of the month it is suggested to click the "RESET" link located at the top of your bills. This will reactivate the "PAY" buttons to be used once again.

<strong>One Time Expenses:</strong> If you spend money on anything that is not a bill (ie. buying a coffee, eating out, etc.) click the "SPEND" button to track one time expenses.

<strong>Add Additional Funds:</strong> If you would like to add more funds to your overall account click the "ADD MONEY" button and enter the required information. 

<strong>Delete A Bill:</strong> Bills can only be deleted from a desktop setting. This is to help insure no bill is accidentally while using the app on a mobile device. To delete a bill click the "REMOVE" link next to the desired bill to be deleted.

If you want to reset your entire "FUNDS LEFT" you can do so at anytime, however be advised that all information once reset can not be retrieved. This can be done by clicking the "RESET" link underneath the "SPEND" button.

I hope this app can help everyone who has been looking for a solution to track their remaining funds.
